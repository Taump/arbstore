			Hi {{real_name}}, someone needs your help!
		</p>
		<p>
			There is a dispute in the contract {{hash}} where you are the arbiter. The dispute was just initiated by the {{role}}, their wallet address is {{plaintiff_address}}.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please open your Obyte wallet and you should receive the contract in a chat message from the ArbStore (we can't send it here because the contract is encrypted and only your wallet can decrypt it). At this point, you need to take a quick look at the contract and reply with the price of your dispute resolution services for this particular case. This price should agree with the pricing you set in your profile at <a href="https://arbstore.org">arbstore.org</a>. Don't start working on the case before the plaintiff pays (you will be notified). The payment will be held by the ArbStore while you work on the case and will be automatically released to you once you post your decision. Please follow the guide <a href="https://arbstore.org/arb-guide">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you need to talk to the plaintiff or the defendant before setting your price, you can do so by following the links in the contract view in your wallet.
		</p>
		<p>
			In case you didn't receive the chat message in your wallet or you have any other questions, please contact ArbStore support at <a href="mailto:support@arbstore.org">support@arbstore.org</a>.
