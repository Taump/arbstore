		<h2>User guide for contracts with arbitration</h2>

		<p>Countracts with artbitration are conventional written contracts coupled with smart contracts that lock the full amount of the contract for its entire duration and guarantee that the funds can be unlocked only with mutual agreement of both parties, or according to the decision of a mutually agreed arbiter in case a dispute arises.</p>

The text should be rather long and spell out all the terms and conditions, rights and obligations in your deal with the other party.</p>

The payment is processed through the ArbStore this arbiter is enrolled with, so the plaintiff will receive a payment request from the ArbStore in chat. The payment will be held by the ArbStore until the arbiter makes a decision.</p>
				<p>After the payment is sent, the arbiter starts resolving the dispute. They will contact both parties through Obyte wallet chat or other means of communication they indicated in the contract, collect evidence from both parties, and make a decision about the party who wins the dispute.</p>

				<p>13. If the losing party is not satisfied with the arbiter's work, they can appeal the arbiter's decision through contract view. This action will invoke an ArbStore moderator. Although the moderator can't reverse the arbiter decision, they can (partially) compensate the appellant if they find that the arbiter's work was unsatisfactory. The moderator will take a payment for their work and look into the arbiter's decision. They can either agree with the arbiter and close the appeal, or agree with the appellant and pay them a fixed compensation out of the arbiter's deposit with the ArbStore.</p>
