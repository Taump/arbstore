		<h2>User guide for contracts with arbitration</h2>
		<p>Every contract with arbitration has two sides of the contract: <b>offerer</b> and <b>acceptor</b>. One of them is a <b>buyer</b>, another one is <b>seller</b>. A third party in the form of <b>arbiter</b> can be called to resolve disputes. As a last resort, in some situations, an ArbStore <b>moderator</b> can step into play to compensate fees to dispute plaintiff, in case of arbiter desicion was wrong (from the plaintiff point of view) or the arbiter behavior was incorrect.</p>
